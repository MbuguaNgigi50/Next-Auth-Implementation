/*
This is the Email Verification API endpoint that will handle all the email verification functionality when a new user is signing up.
The verification process involves sending a csrf Token to the email address that the user used to sign up
The account will then be activated once the user accesses the link in order to complete the sign up flow

****THIS ROUTE ONLY ACCEPTS POST REQUESTS****

TODO ADD THE EMAIL VERIFICATION ROUTE SO THAT A USER CAN ACTIVATE THEIR ACCOUNT AFTER REGISTRATION
